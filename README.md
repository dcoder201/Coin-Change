# Coin-Change

Online Python Challenges



Given an integer array coins[ ] of size N representing different denominations of currency and an integer sum, find the number of ways you can make sum by using different combinations from coins[ ].  
Note: Assume that you have an infinite supply of each type of coin. 


Example 1:

Input:
sum = 4 , 
N = 3
coins[] = {1,2,3}

Output: 4
Explanation: Four Possible ways are:
{1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Example 2:

Input:
Sum = 10 , 
N = 4
coins[] ={2,5,3,6}

Output: 5
Explanation: Five Possible ways are:
{2,2,2,2,2}, {2,2,3,3}, {2,2,6}, {2,3,5} 
and {5,5}.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function count() which accepts an array coins[ ] its size N and sum as input parameters and returns the number of ways to make change for given sum of money. 


Expected Time Complexity: O(sum*N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(sum)


Constraints:
1 <= sum, N <= 103
